# Cipher-Genarator
Just a simple linear deslocation cypher generator using JS.

-Using the generator-
  Open the index.html and insert an integer to act as a encryption key, after that just select the box on the left to encrypt the data or the box on the right to decrypt it, then just hit the button bellow the desired box and enjoy.
  
  Also, try inserting the konami code just for giggles.
